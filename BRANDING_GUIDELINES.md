Self-Defi Branding Guidelines

This document defines how the Self-Defi brand, language, visual identity, and positioning may be referenced when contributing to or extending this repository.

Self-Defi exists to help people gain sovereign control over their digital assets.
Any use of the brand must reinforce that mission — never distort it.

🔹 Core Identity

Self-Defi is:

Digital Infrastructure Architect

Proof-of-Execution Operator

Non-custodial sovereignty advocate

The brand is not:

a fund

a pooled manager

a token issuer

a yield scheme

financial advice

Our identity is architecture + execution — without custody.

🔹 Logos and Assets

The Self-Defi logo and visuals in this repo:

may be used inside this project

may appear in forks or extensions only if attribution is preserved

may not be used to imply endorsement or official affiliation

If you extend the app or white-label it:

✔ keep the Self-Defi attribution in the footer
✔ add your own logo in addition — do not replace ours
✘ do not change Self-Defi’s logo colors, proportions, or typography

If you need alternate versions or file formats, request them before creating derivatives.

🔹 Tone & Voice Requirements

Any written contribution must reflect Self-Defi’s voice:

✔ direct
✔ professional
✔ fact-based
✔ forward-thinking
✔ no hype or inflated promises

Avoid:

✘ “get rich” marketing
✘ guaranteed return language
✘ technical mysticism
✘ anything implying Self-Defi manages capital for users

Use framing like:

“This vault allocates into…”
“Yield depends on market conditions…”
“Users sign transactions directly…”

🔹 Messaging Rules

When referencing Self-Defi:

✔ emphasize non-custodial architecture
✔ make it clear users hold their own keys
✔ position Self-Defi as infrastructure + advisory, not as executor of transactions

Correct framing examples:

“Self-Defi provides the vault architecture — you execute it with your wallet.”

“Self-Defi is the blueprint; users maintain control.”

Incorrect framing examples:

❌ “Self-Defi manages your assets.”
❌ “Deposit funds into Self-Defi vaults.”
❌ “Self-Defi guarantees a yield.”

🔹 Naming Rules

You may reference:

Self-Defi Vault Architecture

Self-Defi Advisory Model

Self-Defi Order-Flow Vault Stack

You may not reference:

Self-Defi Investment Fund

Self-Defi Hedge Fund

Self-Defi Managed Vaults

Self-Defi Custody Services

Brand equity depends on **
zero false implication of fund management
**.

🔹 Visual Usage

Theme guidelines for imagery and UI:

✔ minimal
✔ soft gradients
✔ light neutrals
✔ blue/gold responsibility tones
✔ grid-based layouts
✔ emphasis on clarity

Avoid:

✘ neon hype styles
✘ casino/aura visuals
✘ anything that implies gambling or gamification

The interface must always communicate:

stability, sovereignty, discipline.

🔹 Attribution Requirements

If you extend, fork, or reuse branding:

Include somewhere in footer, docs, or splash:

“Architecture inspired by Self-Defi — used under MIT license.”

If you co-brand:

“Powered by Self-Defi Vault Architecture.”

Do not erase attribution or imply proprietary license unless written permission is granted.

🔹 As This Repo Evolves

Once wallet connect, routing, and reporting modules go live:

branding rules become even stricter

disclaimers will be required in front-end UI

pull requests with improper brand framing will be rejected immediately

🔹 Contact for Brand Clarification

Questions on usage, partnership, or co-branding requests should go directly to:

📌 Final Positioning Reminder

Self-Defi is infrastructure that empowers users, not a party that holds their keys.

Any branding, messaging, UI copy, or external representation must make this sovereignty explicit.
