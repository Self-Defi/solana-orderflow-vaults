# Self-Defi Order-Flow Vaults — Roadmap

This roadmap expresses execution intent, not promises.
Timelines adjust based on testing, demand, and market conditions.

---

## Phase 1 — Architecture UI (Complete / Current)
- Vault definitions (Reserve, Growth, Velocity)
- Non-custodial framing
- repository structure + branding
- CONTRIBUTING / SECURITY / LICENSE

Result:
A usable education + advisory platform.

---

## Phase 2 — Data Visibility Layer
- Solana RPC integrations (read-only)
- on-chain JitoSOL yield display
- lending market utilization feeds
- CLMM fee range statistics
- basic vault health dashboards

Result:
Live visibility without execution.

---

## Phase 3 — Wallet Connect Layer
- Phantom / Backpack / Jupiter wallet adapters
- detect balances + vault state
- transaction preview generation (simulation-only)

Result:
Users visualize before signing.

---

## Phase 4 — Vault Routing Prototype
- deterministic allocation flows for each vault type
- risk guardrails (LTV caps, validator caps)
- optional unwind / exit logic
- signature-only execution (no custody)

Result:
Minimal viable self-directed vault deploy UX.

---

## Phase 5 — Reporting & Institutional Interfaces
- school + family reports
- downloadable PDF ledger exports
- transparency UI for oversight / trustees
- wallet reconciliation surface

Result:
Institution-grade accountability.

---

## Phase 6 — Multi-Vault and Role Control
- per-student vault scaffolding
- school vault aggregation
- architecture reuse for other programs

Result:
Vault infrastructure becomes modular and scale-ready.

---

## Phase 7 — Evaluation + Go/No-go on broader productization
- risk model stress testing
- third-party review queries
- school pilot feedback
- DAO treasuries pilot

---

## Status Notes
This project moves deliberately — sovereignty and correctness over speed.
