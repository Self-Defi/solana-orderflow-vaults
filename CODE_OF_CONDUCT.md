# Self-Defi — Code of Conduct

This project operates under the same discipline as its architecture: 
clear boundaries, respectful interaction, and sovereignty-first values.

## 1. Respect the Mission
Self-Defi exists to empower users to control their own digital assets.

Any participation that undermines user sovereignty, 
promotes custodial dependence, or distorts this mission will be rejected.

## 2. Professionalism
All contributors will:
- communicate clearly
- avoid personal attacks
- assume good intent
- keep critique technical, not emotional

## 3. No Hype / No Misleading Claims
Do not:
- market guaranteed yields
- imply Self-Defi manages user capital
- use language that exploits unsophisticated audiences

We tell it like it is — no exaggeration, no deception.

## 4. Collaboration Rules
Contributors should:
- clearly document reasoning
- explain design choices
- write commits that others can understand
- respond to review feedback constructively

## 5. Boundary Enforcement
Community moderators and maintainers may:
- edit or redirect discussions
- close unproductive threads
- remove contributors who repeatedly violate mission alignment

## 6. Reporting Issues
If someone violates this Code of Conduct, report through:
- GitHub private issue tagged “conduct”
- direct contact with project maintainer

## 7. Attribution & IP 
Respect attribution requirements and branding guidelines.
Do not use the Self-Defi name to imply partnership, custody, or product endorsement.

## 8. Final Reminder
This project reflects institutional discipline — 
be concise, be respectful, build with sovereignty in mind.
