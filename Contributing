Contributing to Self-Defi: Solana Order-Flow Vaults

First — thank you for your interest in improving this infrastructure.

This repo is a front-end prototype and architectural blueprint, not a production protocol.
Every improvement helps refine the foundation for future wallet-connected execution.

🔹 Philosophy

Self-Defi is Proof-of-Execution first:

We value clarity over hype

We ship working models, not theories

We build systems where users retain custody and autonomy

All contributions should reflect that mindset.

🔹 What Contributions Are Welcome?

✔ UI refinements
✔ data visualization
✔ modularity improvements
✔ Solana yield data integrations
✔ vault performance modeling
✔ architecture insights
✔ documentation or UX copy based on real-world experience

Not welcome:

✖ hype-driven “APY promises”
✖ anything implying custodianship or pooled asset management
✖ code that abstracts away signing authority from the user

🔹 How to Contribute
1. Fork the repo
git fork https://github.com/Self-Defi/solana-orderflow-vaults.git

2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/solana-orderflow-vaults.git
cd solana-orderflow-vaults

3. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-improvement

4. Make changes and commit

Follow clear, descriptive commits:

✔ feat: add tooltip UI
✔ refactor: improve vault rendering logic
✔ docs: clarify yield model language

5. Push and open a pull request
git push origin feature/your-improvement


Then submit a PR via GitHub.

🔹 Pull Request Requirements

To maintain clarity and minimalism:

Explain why your change matters

Keep changes clean and focused

If UI related, include screenshots

If protocol/data related, cite source logic

We review PRs for:

clarity

maintainability

alignment with Self-Defi principles

non-custodial execution safety

🔹 Coding style

This repository is intentionally simple:

vanilla JS

HTML

CSS

When proposing more advanced architecture:

✓ isolate additions
✓ document how they evolve the vault system
✓ avoid creating false expectations around automated yield execution

🔹 Security Considerations

Even though this is front-end only:

never commit private keys or wallet files

avoid including sensitive API secrets or RPC keys

report potential vulnerabilities privately before disclosing publicly

A dedicated SECURITY.md is coming — but you may contact the project owner directly via GitHub or LinkedIn.

🔹 Roadmap Context

This code is intentionally scaffolded to evolve toward:

wallet connect

read-only on-chain data

routing logic

reporting exports

If you contribute in these areas, document:

risks

assumptions

future integration points

Your contribution becomes part of a live evolution plan.

🔹 Attribution

Contributors will be attributed via:

PR merge history

README acknowledgements for major work

possible future inclusion in internal documentation

🔹 Final Reminder

This is Self-Defi infrastructure —
not pooled capital management, and not automated yield promises.

The mission is to help families, schools, and DAOs manage their own assets with confidence — without ever relinquishing control.

If your contributions push that mission forward, we welcome you.
